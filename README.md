# Maria-Kolesnikova. About Me

Hi, I’m Maria 👋

I’m a backend developer with a strong background in business automation and project management. Earlier in my career, I worked with small and medium businesses to design and implement ERP-based automation solutions, balancing deep understanding of each company’s needs with building adaptable frameworks.

After taking time to raise my children, I dedicated the past year to studying backend development with Python and Django. Now, I combine my technical skills with my experience in process optimization and business analysis to build efficient, scalable, and user-focused solutions.

🌱 Currently improving my skills in backend engineering, REST APIs, and deployment.
💡 Interested in projects at the intersection of business automation and software development.
📍 Based in Silicon Valley, USA.
